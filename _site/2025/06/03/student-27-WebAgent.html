<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>

<p>Graphical User Interface (GUI) web agents are autonomous agents that interact with websites much like a human user – by clicking, typing, and reading on web pages. In recent years, especially since 2023/2024, there has been rapid progress in developing general-purpose GUI web agents powered by large (multimodal) language models (LLMs). These agents aim to follow high-level instructions (e.g. “Find the cheapest red jacket on an online store and add it to the cart”) and execute various tasks across different websites.</p>

<p>A key challenge driving current research is reasoning capability: GUI agents must plan multi-step actions, handle dynamic web content, hop between different web pages, and sometimes recover from mistakes or unexpected outcomes. This report surveys recent developments in this area, emphasizing how new architectures and training methods have enhanced reasoning, with a special focus on e-commerce applications (a domain that is naitively multi-modal, and demands sophisticated multi-step reasoning, such as searching for products, comparing options, and completing purchases). We also contrast these GUI agents with earlier text-based web agents to highlight differences in reasoning approaches.</p>

<h2 id="background-from-text-based-to-multi-modal-web-agents">Background: From Text-Based to Multi-modal Web Agents</h2>

<p>Early “web agents” were often text-based, interfacing with the web via textual inputs/outputs or APIs rather than through a visual GUI. For example, a text-based agent might read the HTML or use a browser’s accessibility layer to get page text, then choose an action like following a link or submitting a form by ID. Notable early systems included OpenAI’s WebGPT (2021) [1] for web question-answering and various reinforcement learning (RL) agents on simplified web environments. These text-based agents relied on parsing textual content and often used search engine APIs or DOM trees. Their reasoning largely resembled traditional NLP tasks – e.g. retrieving relevant information or doing reading comprehension – and they did not need to reason about layout or visual elements.</p>

<p>By contrast, GUI web agents operate on the actual rendered web interface (like a human using a browser). This introduces new challenges and differences in reasoning.</p>

<p>The first one is <em>Perception and Grounding</em>: GUI agents must interpret the visual layout and GUI elements. They may receive a DOM tree or a rendered screenshot of the page. For instance, a task might involve recognizing a “red BUY button” or an image of a product. Text-only models struggle with such visual cues. Thus, GUI agents often incorporate vision (to understand images, colors, iconography) in addition to text. Reasoning for GUI agents often means linking instructions to the correct GUI element or image – a form of grounded reasoning not present in purely text agents.</p>

<p>The second one is <em>Action Space &amp; Planning</em>: A text-based agent’s actions can be abstract (e.g. “go to URL” or “click link by name”), whereas a GUI agent deals with low-level events (mouse clicks, typing) on specific coordinates or element IDs. This requires more procedural reasoning: the agent must plan a sequence of GUI operations to achieve the goal. Often the agent must navigate through multiple pages or UI states, which demands long-horizon planning. For example, buying a product involves searching, filtering results, clicking the item, adding to cart, and possibly checkout – multiple steps that must be reasoned about and executed in order. Modern GUI agents leverage LLMs’ ability to plan by breaking down goals into sub-goals, sometimes explicitly writing out multi-step plans [2]. In comparison, text-based agents typically handle shorter-horizon tasks (like finding a specific fact on Wikipedia) with simpler sequential reasoning.</p>

<p>The third one is <em>Dynamic Interaction and Uncertainty</em>: Web GUIs are dynamic – pages can change or have pop-ups, and incorrect actions can lead the agent astray. GUI agents need robust error recovery strategies. This has led to new reasoning techniques like reflection and rollback. For example, an agent might try an action, realize it led to an irrelevant page, and then go back and try an alternative – a capability highlighted as essential in recent work [3]. Text agents, while they also handle some dynamic choices (e.g. picking the next link to click), typically operate in a more static information space and have less need for such UI-specific recovery reasoning.</p>

<p>GUI web agents require visual understanding, sequential decision-making, and error-aware reasoning that goes beyond what text-based agents historically needed. These differences have encouraged new research directions to equip GUI agents with better reasoning skills. Before diving into those developments, we next overview the benchmarks and environments that have been created to train and evaluate modern GUI web agents.</p>

<h2 id="core-benchmarks">Core Benchmarks</h2>

<p>In recent years, several benchmarks and agent frameworks have been proposed to evaluate and advance autonomous agents that can interact with websites through a graphical user interface (GUI). These systems combine natural language understanding, web page vision/DOM parsing, and action execution (clicking, typing, etc.) to follow instructions on real or simulated websites. In this section, we review five notable recent projects – VisualWebArena, Mind2Web, Online-Mind2Web, WebVoyager, and RealWebAssist – focusing on their core ideas, evaluation methodologies (tasks, datasets, metrics), key results, and the strengths/limitations of each approach.</p>

<h3 id="visualwebarena">VisualWebArena</h3>

<p>VisualWebArena (VWA) is a benchmark designed to test multimodal web agents on realistic tasks that require visual understanding of web content [4]. Prior web agent benchmarks mostly used text-only information, but VWA includes images and graphical elements as integral parts of the tasks. The goal is to evaluate an agent’s ability to process image-text inputs, interpret natural language instructions, and execute actions on websites to accomplish user-defined objectives. This benchmark builds on the WebArena framework (a realistic web environment) by introducing new tasks where visual content is crucial (e.g. identifying items by images or interpreting graphical page elements).</p>

<p>VWA comprises 910 diverse tasks in three web domains: an online Classifieds site (newly created with real-world data), an e-Shopping site, and a Reddit-style forum. Tasks range from purchasing specific products (which may require recognizing product images) to navigating forums with embedded media. Agents interact with webpages that are self-hosted for consistency. Success is measured by whether the agent achieves the correct end state on the website (functional task completion). Human performance on these tasks is about 88–89% success, indicating the tasks are feasible for people but non-trivial. An example task is: “Find a listing for a red convertible car on the classifieds site and report its price” – requires the agent to visually identify the car’s image/color on the page (beyond just text).</p>

<p>The benchmark supports various agent types. The authors evaluated state-of-the-art large language model (LLM) based agents, including text-only agents and vision-enabled agents (e.g. GPT-4 with vision, open-source vision-language models). Agents observe either a DOM-derived accessibility tree (textual interface) or the rendered webpage image (for vision models), sometimes augmented with image captions (generated by a tool like BLIP-2) for text models. Agents produce actions such as clicking UI elements or entering text. Some experiments also used a Set-of-Mark (SoM) [5] approach – a method to highlight possible interactive elements for the agent to consider – to aid decision making</p>

<p><strong>Key Results</strong>: Text-Only vs Multimodal: A GPT-4 based agent using only text (no vision) achieved under 10% success on VWA tasks (≈7% in one setting). In contrast, GPT-4V (Vision-enabled GPT-4) achieved roughly 15% overall success, more than doubling the success rate by leveraging page images. Even augmenting a text agent with image captions improved success to ~12.8%, but fell short of a true vision model. This underscores that visual context is often critical: purely text-based agents miss cues that are obvious to multimodal agents (e.g. recognizing a product from its photo). The evaluation showed text-only LLM agents often fail when tasks involve identifying visual attributes (colors, shapes, etc.) or non-textual cues. VisualWebArena is the first benchmark to focus on visually-grounded web tasks in a realistic setting. It provides a controlled environment with reproducible websites, enabling rigorous comparison of agents. It highlights the importance of vision in web agents: many real-world web tasks (shopping for an item of a certain style, recognizing icons/buttons, etc.) cannot be solved by text parsing alone.</p>

<h3 id="mind2web">Mind2Web</h3>

<p>Mind2Web is introduced as the first large-scale dataset for developing and evaluating a “generalist” web agent – one that can follow natural language instructions to complete complex tasks on any website [6]. Prior benchmarks often used either simulated web pages or a limited set of websites/tasks, which risked overfitting. Mind2Web instead emphasizes breadth and diversity: it contains over 2,000 tasks collected from 137 real-world websites spanning 31 domains (e-commerce, social media, travel, etc.). Each task is open-ended (expressed in natural language) and comes with a human-crowdsourced action sequence demonstrating how to complete it, providing both a goal specification and a ground-truth solution path.</p>

<h3 id="online-mind2web">Online-Mind2Web</h3>

<p>Online-Mind2Web is a follow-up benchmark that addresses a critical question: Are web agents as competent as some benchmarks suggest, or are we seeing an illusion of progress? [7] The authors of this study argue that previously reported results might be overly optimistic due to evaluation on static or simplified environments. Online-Mind2Web instead evaluates agents in a live web setting, where they must perform tasks on actual, up-to-date websites – thus exposing them to real-world variability and unpredictability. It consists of 300 diverse tasks spanning 136 popular websites, collected to approximate how real users would instruct an agent online. This includes tasks across domains like shopping, travel, social media, etc., similar in spirit to Mind2Web’s diversity but executed on the real web.</p>

<p>The authors developed an LLM-as-a-Judge system called WebJudge to automatically evaluate whether an agent succeeded in a given task, with minimal human labor. WebJudge uses an LLM to analyze the agent’s action history and the resulting web states (with key screenshots) to decide if the goal was achieved. This method achieved about 85% agreement with human evaluators on success judgments, substantially higher consistency than prior automatic metrics, substantially higher consistency than prior automatic metrics.</p>

<h3 id="webvoyager">WebVoyager</h3>

<p>WebVoyager [8] has a set of tasks that are open-ended user instructions that require multi-step interactions. For example, tasks might include “Book a hotel room in New York for next weekend on Booking.com” or “Find and compare the prices of two specific smartphones on an e-commerce site”. The tasks are meant to reflect practical web goals (searching, form-filling, navigating multi-page flows, etc.) and often require combining information gathering with action execution. Because evaluating success on such open tasks can be tricky, WebVoyager’s authors used an automatic evaluation protocol leveraging GPT-4V (similar in spirit to WebJudge). They had GPT-4V examine the agent’s outcome (e.g., final page or sequence of pages visited) and compare it to the intended goal, achieving about 85% agreement with human judgment of success.</p>

<p>Its benchmark and results validated that multimodal agents can substantially outperform text-only agents on real-world websites. Another strength is the introduction of an automatic evaluation metric with GPT-4V to reduce reliance on slow human evaluation</p>

<h3 id="realwebassist">RealWebAssist</h3>

<p>RealWebAssist [9] is a benchmark aimed at long-horizon, sequential web assistance with real users. Unlike one-shot tasks (e.g. “buy X from Amazon”), this benchmark considers scenarios where a user interacts with an AI assistant over an extended session comprising multiple interdependent instructions. The key idea is to simulate a personal web assistant that can handle an evolving to-do list or goal that unfolds through conversation. RealWebAssist addresses several real-world complexities not covered in prior benchmarks. It extends the challenge to interactive, personalized assistance, highlighting the significant gap between current AI capabilities and the full vision of a personal web assistant that can handle ambiguous, evolving user needs over long sessions.</p>

<p>For example, a user might start with “I need a gift for my mother’s birthday”, then later add “She likes gardening” – the agent must adjust its plan. The benchmark includes such evolving goals. The agent might need to learn or keep track of a particular user’s preferences/routines. E.g., “Order my usual Friday takeout” implies knowing what “usual” means for that user. Instructions come from real users (not annotators inventing them), so they reflect personal language quirks and context assumptions.</p>

<p>As with other GUI agents, the assistant must interface with actual web pages (click buttons, fill forms). RealWebAssist emphasizes aligning instructions with the correct GUI actions – e.g., if the user says “open the second result,” the agent must translate that to clicking the second item on the page.</p>

<p>The benchmark consists of sequential instruction episodes collected from real users. For evaluation, the authors consider the following evaluation metrics:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Task success rate: Measures whether the web agent successfully executes all instructions in a given task sequence.</li>
  <li>Average progress: Calculates what percentage of instructions the agent completes correctly before making its first mistake in a task.</li>
  <li>Step success rate: Evaluates the agent’s performance in a controlled setting where it only needs to handle one instruction at a time, with all previous steps assumed to be completed successfully.</li>
</ul>
